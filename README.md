# Repository Retired

⚠️ This repository is **retired** and no longer maintained.

I have merged all **circular and elliptical Keplerian template bank search** functionality into **Peasoup**:

**[Peasoup Repo Link](https://github.com/ewanbarr/peasoup)**

Please refer to the **Peasoup README** for setup and usage instructions.


# 3D_peasoup
C++/CUDA GPU pulsar searching library that can search coherently for circular binary orbits using the template-bank algorithm.
This pipeline was built on the original code written almost entirely by Ewan Barr (MPIfR). You can find the original repo here that does an 1-D acceleration search. https://github.com/ewanbarr/peasoup 

This repo. does a coherent search for circular binary orbits (3 binary parameters) using the Random/Stochastic Template-Bank algorithm. You can read more about this algorithm in Messenger (2008), Harry (2009), Knispel (2011) and Allen (2013).
